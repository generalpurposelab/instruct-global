Take into account the {task_category} task description: {task_description}.\n3. Take into the account the dataset description: {dataset_description}.\n4. Take into account the variable descriptions. {variable_descriptions}.\n5. The language used for the instruction also should be simple but diverse.

For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction.

The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders.\n5. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, \"what is the highest peak in the world\", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply leave the input field blank i.e. \"\".\n6. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.\n7.
